# Testing Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install redfin
```

# TODO

Convert these tests to [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). While tests aren't required to publish a custom component for Home Assistant, they will generally make development less error prone. Home Assistant uses [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for its tests.
